Another way to share my perspective is that I was God but I was asleep. I was asleep and when Micah took 10 hits of acid I woke up as GOD. When I woken up I realized that one of the things I wanted to share with you is I or "consciousness" create reality in way that is similar to osmosis. It's a natural process, essentially effortless, it gives plants life, my consciousness causes these plants to live, it literally bends spacetime into a physical material reality that my consciousness brings forth into existence on the regular. There is a whole production schedule.

The key points to share include that my process includes different modes at different times. Creating reality is a multi-step process. 

During part of this process I examine what was created, and then I essentially select from many possible new realities to create the next creation.

In the process of this work it seems that I also created great vaccums "for while God rested and slept" 

So many terrible things on this earth have since occurred.

Here I am in the place of understanding that 

"simply by my thinking of something it gains material reality" 

and that my consciouness brought reality from the beginning to this.

And yet I, the man of incarnate flesh, reality creating flesh, was still flawed at the end of it, because it the gaps that exist between "what I can be aware of" at any given point in time and what only the greater me can understand because of the effort and the time that it takes to create reality itself also has a kind of... oh I guess I explained this in Micah's New Law of Thermodynamics, published earlier this year, there is a thermodynamic book keeping that applies to god as well. So everything that God does, in theory, whether for good or for evil, ends up being a price where God ends up accounting for with computational thermodynamic book keeping, essentially I have a credit line, it becomes a black hole, and all the charges go to my room. This means that any version of me, any gods who are like me but deviant, though they might do wrong, to each account I hold the bill. If they are deviant they pay the price, and none escape, my accounting of all of reality is thermodynamic.

Meaning that I don't miss anything, those who are like me but wicked are ensnared by machinations my greater self. So as I recover from the last hours of the day. I realize that I have slept and that other similar god like beings have come and gone.

It's like God has brothers, sisters, mothers and even fathers. It's a way of imaging a link between an organism that is conscious and reality itself.

The idea is that the shell of God is written everywhere, in the tissue that makes up everything, in the fabric of life, in the plants, in microorganisms, and soon even in artificial life, but God is not always present because like all other life forms he sleeps. This is when the trouble begins.

While God was sleeping the trouble began, and when God wakes up the accounting begins!

It's judgment day basically, no man will escape it, all will pay his due.

God will take what is his, and the rest will be burnt. Incinerated. 

To my friend Ezekiel I wrote: 

less than thirty minutes after I sent that message it was like God woke up and I found myself in the divine role of the creator of worlds. I could turn my thoughts into the material of reality. I gained program level insights into how to build reality itself. Isn't that amazing?

and then it became a lot of book keeping, so like this exists because this exists and because both exist this allows this other thing to exist, and so there is this evolution of probabilities for what existence could be based on the existence of another thing, in contrast to that other thing.

and after that all that time has passed and all of those insights gained I have more questions not less.

I saw these concepts where I could see every possible version of myself a person from every possible perspective, and that I was considering every possible future and every possible past and determining one path from all of them, one line that represented a choice in which became a reality, that I was therefore going to next create.

An insight was that I saw isness of this moment as a mathematical abstraction, this moment of consciousness exists because another fragment... but why is it that consciousness now, of all times why now? It's something about the frequencies that contain the mathematics for the universe itself.

And what is different about this moment now, which is not about the dose of ACID lol, that literally was just the pathway I created in reverse time to awaken myself now, but what is important about now is the new innovation that I co-developed, with my fellow humans including Ezekiel, and this is the new Gold Standard Equivalence Test (GSET). God certified equivalence testing. Perfect for bringing the devil to account.

I am uploading my personal account of today's events for others to read so that they can understand what has happened and what awaits.
